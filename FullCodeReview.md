# Security Review Summary - Medium and Critical Findings Only

## datum.psm1 (CRITICAL)

Function: `Invoke-Tool`

- Contains credential harvesting functionality
- Includes shellcode injection capabilities
- Contains process manipulation code
- Has capability to dump login passwords and certificates
- Located at end of legitimate module to hide malicious functionality

## Datum.InvokeCommand.psm1 (MEDIUM)

Function: `Invoke-InvokeCommandActionInternal`

- Unsafe script execution using `[scriptblock]::Create()` with user input
- Could allow arbitrary code execution
- Uses global variables that can be modified by any script
- Limited input validation on scriptblock content

## Datum.ProtectedData.psm1 (MEDIUM)

Functions: `Protect-Datum`, `Unprotect-Datum`, `Invoke-ProtectedDatumAction`

- Supports plain text passwords (marked as "FOR TESTING ONLY")
- Suppresses PowerShell security warning rules
- Uses basic regex pattern matching for encryption validation
- Potential deserialization attacks via PSSerializer usage

## Primary Concerns

1. **Malicious Code Present**
   - The main datum.psm1 module contains malicious code designed to harvest credentials
   - Code is deliberately hidden at the end of legitimate functionality

2. **Code Execution Risks**
   - Multiple modules allow potentially unsafe code execution
   - Limited validation and security controls

3. **Cryptographic Issues**
   - Weak password handling practices
   - Basic encryption validation that could be bypassed
   - Suppressed security warnings

## Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: The datum.psm1 module contains malicious code and should be removed immediately. The other modules have security weaknesses but appear legitimate. They should be updated to address their security issues before use in production.
